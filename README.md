In this repositry i will be explaining typescript, benefits of type safety and broad best practices in software engineering. 

Brainstorm this, as its only a draft,
What is typescript? before i can answer that i will need to tell you what is javascript, and before that what is the web, when the first web was developed it was oriented around html, 
HTML stand for hyper text markup language, it was static and only used to consume information, than css was introduced for the appearing of various websites to enhance the apears of 
indivuals websites, than javascript was introduced that changed the web from consume information only to now can be able to send and recieve information, functinility that was introuduced was, 
been able to fill form, extange information, and people were able to order pizza for the first time ever without calling through the web, every year that went pass javascript was improved
and builded on top of the scripting language, as you probably heard javascript was developed in 10 days yep, dont know if its 100% true but anyways beside the point, unlike other programming
lanagues didnt receive strategic planning, leaving many pot holes in the langauge, such as not having it build around a compiler or safety typing to intilize the varibale with its data value, 
causing many problems that were only can be discovered through run time only, as its too late to get ride of the programming language and build from start up causing many websites from the
pass not to be cross-compatible now, ECMAScript decided to upgrade the langauge every year to add new functionality which are highly appreciated however upgrades are slow, thats where typescript
comes in many of the features that will be introudeced by ECMAScript later on Typescript introduced few years before, typescript works as a compilor and eliminates the need to only detected your
error on runtime but be able to detect while coding, typescript is optional, to utilise typescript benfits whill need to wrap the varibale, function or classes with safety typo add on, that will
create a safety net around the code incase anything goes wrong. Thanks
